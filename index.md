## About
I am a second year PhD Candidate in the [Cryptology and Data Security Lab](https://crypto.unibe.ch/)
at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) 
of the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/), advised by Prof. [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/).

My research interests include distributed systems and protocols, such as blockchains, consensus, and smart contracts,
with a focus on their efficiency and on generalizing their trust assumptions. I am also interested in threshold cryptography
and multiparty computation. My work is primarily systems-oriented; however, I also enjoy understanding and 
exploring theoretical solutions that can potentially advance real-world technology.

Prior to joining UniBe, I graduated from the school of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](//www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at [National Technical University of Athens](//www.ntua.gr/en/). I did my master thesis on network security with deep learning methods at [Netmode Lab](http://www.netmode.ntua.gr/main/).

+ Multiparty computation based on secret sharing (mainly SDPZ), [presentation](/archive/oa/generalized_quorums-srds.pdf) at our CRYPTO research seminar

## Teaching
In Fall Semester 2020 I was a teaching assistant in the master course 'Cryptography', and in Fall Semester 2019 I assisted in the bachelor course 'Discrete Mathematics' at UniBe.
