Hi, I'm Orestis. I research and build distributed systems and threshold-cryptographic protocols. I am currently a PhD candidate at University of Bern.


## About {#about}
I am a second year PhD Candidate in the [Cryptology and Data Security Lab](https://crypto.unibe.ch/)
at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.inf.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) 
of the [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/), advised by Prof. [Christian Cachin](https://crypto.unibe.ch/cc/).

Prior to joining UniBe, I graduated from the school of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](//www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at [National Technical University of Athens](//www.ntua.gr/en/). I did my master thesis on network security with deep learning methods at [Netmode Lab](http://www.netmode.ntua.gr/main/).


## Research
My research interests include distributed systems and protocols, such as blockchains, consensus, and smart contracts,
with a focus on their efficiency and on generalizing their trust assumptions. I am also interested in threshold cryptography
and multiparty computation. My work is primarily systems-oriented; however, I also enjoy understanding and 
exploring theoretical solutions that can potentially advance real-world technology.
